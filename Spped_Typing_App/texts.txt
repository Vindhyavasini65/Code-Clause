Doctors shape society and help it to grow.
Healthcare is the most basic and fundamental human right. 
I learned that the hard way.
My journey on the path to medicine didn’t begin the typical way.
I wasn’t interested in becoming a doctor at all.
The importance of medicine hit me in the face when the person I loved most in the world got sick.
